After the fire of 1805, Campus Martius (from the Latin for Field of Mars, where Roman heroes walked) was the focal point of Judge Augustus Woodward's plans to rebuild the city. It was named for the principal square in Marietta, Ohio, the first capital of the Northwest Territories.The park is located at the intersection of Woodward Avenue and Michigan Avenue, four blocks south of Grand Circus Park. The original park covered several acres and was a major gathering area for citizens. The park was lost in the 1900s as the city's downtown was reconfigured to accommodate increased vehicular traffic. Hart Plaza, along the riverfront, was designed to replace Campus Martius as a point of importance. But as Hart Plaza is a primarily hard-surfaced area, many residents came to lament the lack of true park space in the city's downtown area. This led to calls to rebuild Campus Martius, the site of the Civil War-era Michigan Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, located across from the new Compuware Headquarters. The park is also where the point of origin of Detroit's coordinate system is located. Seven miles (11 km) north of this point is Seven Mile Road; eight miles (13 km) north is Eight Mile Road, and so on. The point of origin is marked by a medallion embedded in the stone walkway.

        Location(name: "Fox Theatre Detroit", coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 42.3385, longitude: -83.0524), description: "Fox Theatre Detroit is a beautiful theatre in downtown Detroit, Michigan. Opened in 1928 as the flagship movie palace for the Fox Theatre Chain, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1988 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The Fox has a capacity of 5,048 seats and plays host to many top shows and events. The Detroit Fox was built by film pioneer William Fox and is now the largest surviving movie palace of the 1920s and the largest of the Fox Theatres that were originally built. When The Fox opened it was the second largest theatre in the world and it took 18 months to build. It was the first theatre in the world to be made with built-in equipment for talking movies using “Movietone” which was The Fox Film Corporation’s patented sound-on-film system that allowed the theatre to show sound films from it’s opening onwards. The Fox was designed by architect Charles Howard Crane, a Detroiter who designed 250 theatres in North America, 62 of those in the Detroit area. The theatre has a lavish interior with a blend of eastern motifs. The exterior has a 10-story marquee that overlooks Woodward Avenue. The stunning lobby covers half a block. The Fox was bought in 1987 by Olympia Entertainment, owned by Mike and Marion Ilitch and the building was fully restored to it’s former glory in 1988 at a cost of $12 million. Ray Shepardson who oversaw the restoration stated that “The Detroit Fox is the most spectacular, over-the-top movie palace ever built”. The interior of the theatre is something to be experience just for its own sake. You enter into the outer foyer through the brass doors and make your way into the colossal grand lobby which covers 3,600 squre feet and rises six stories high. The main auditorium was designed by Eve Leo, the wife of William Fox (the movie mogul who owned hundreds of movie houses in the country of which the Fox Theatre in Detroit was the grandest) and features Egyptian, Indian and Oriental motifs, such as the elephant’s head in the center of the proscenium. The auditorium is 104 ft high and 175 ft wide and has 2,898 orchestra-level seats, with more on the upper level seating area. As well as serving as Detroit’s premier movie house until the 1980’s, The Fox has a rich history of top class live productions and performances. In the 1930’s Shirley Temple made many appearences when the theatre featured her films. In May 1956 The Fox hosted three performances by Elvis Presley to a total audience of 12,500 screaming fans. Many Motown artists performed on stage in the 1960’s, and from the early 60’s onwards Berry Gordy’s Motown Revue was an annual Christmas Tradtion lasting over the Christmas to New Year’s period with four or five performances every day featuring Detroit talent such as The Temptations, The Supremes and Smokey Robinson. The theatre showed many blaxploitation and martial arts films during this decade. After the restoration, The Fox reopened in 1988 with Smokie Robinson and the Count Basie Orchestra. A year later Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Liza Minnelli appeared in concert. Live productions have included Sesame Street Live, David Copperfield, Donny Osmond and Riverdance. Musicians and comedians to have graced the stage include Prince, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Cher and Kanye West. At present The Fox, which is also aptly known as the “Temple of Amusement” continues to serves as a premier entertainment venue in Detroit for concerts, comedy acts, musicals and other live productions.", type: .music, color: .music, image: "fox", Adderess: "2211,Woodward,Ave,,Detroit,,MI,48201" ),

It was built in 1928 as the Wilson Theatre, designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1976, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. John Francis Dodge and his brother Horace were original investors in Ford Motor Company who sold their interest to Henry Ford and established their own company, the Dodge Motor Company, in 1914. Both brothers died in 1920, leaving their respective widows very wealthy women. Matilda Dodge Wilson, John's widow, married in 1925 to Alfred Wilson, was interested in stage productions and decided to use part of her fortune to build a venue in Detroit to serve as home to a repertory troupe, and to host touring Broadway performers. She hired the prominent Detroit architectural firm of Smith, Hinchman & Grylls who assigned William Kapp to design the building and spent $1.5 million on the construction. At the time of its opening in 1928, the building was dubbed the Wilson Theatre. Since the day we opened our doors in 1928, Music Hall has been a downtown Detroit cultural icon -- changing and evolving to serve the community over nine decades. In 2006, under the leadership of Chairman Alex L. Parrish, the Board of Trustees hired Vincent C. Paul as President and Artistic Director. A Detroit native, Vince returned home after a twenty-year show business career based in New York and traveling the world. In 2008 the global financial crisis severely impacted the funding models of Detroit arts & cultural institutions, requiring an innovative approach. Mr. Paul brought that and more, creating sustainability and leading Music Hall into a new era. A former cloakroom became the space now known as Aretha's Jazz Cafe. A raw rooftop with stunning 360 city views became the wildly popular 3Fifty Terrace, and an unsightly surface lot -- the lush garden oasis that is the Music Hall Amphitheater. In 2022, Music Hall remains true to its roots as a 'variety house' -- presenting a wide spectrum of music, theater, and dance. If our work is hard to categorize, then we're doing our job -- offering an inclusive place of cultural community where we gather old friends and new to celebrate and share our cultural best.", type: .music, color: .music, image: "hall", Adderess: "350,Madison,St,,Detroit,,MI,48226"),

The businesses have operated continuously in the same locations ever since. Both of these Detroit Coney Islands are incredibly popular to this day, where there is an on-going argument over which establishment serves the best Coney dog. A true Coney uses made-in-Michigan products such as Dearborn Sausage wieners. The chili recipes, key to the Coney dog, differ: American makes it own chili which is said to be spicier than the beefier chili of Lafayette, made from a family recipe. The dispute has been featured on several food television shows, including Food Wars and Man v. Food. American Coney Island continues to be owned by the third-generation Keros family, but Lafayette is no longer family-held. There are hundreds of Coney Island restaurants in Michigan, some of the larger Detroit area chains are Leo’s and National.
